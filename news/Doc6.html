        One of the most common dilemmas faced by dog owners is dealing with ticks in dogs.
They are almost invisible to the naked eye and are pretty hard to avoid as they inhabit many different environments. Ticks can cause some pretty serious diseases to your pet, so it’s important to identify and get rid of them quickly.
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><b>Symptoms</b></font>
<br>
<br>
Tick bites have no direct symptoms. It’s only when the disease they carry infects your dog, does it become apparent that they have ticks. Symptoms caused by ticks are not specific and may cover a wide spectrum of issues. These may range from a loss of appetite, weight loss, bleeding disorders and or vomiting.
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><b>Searching for ticks</b></font>
<br>
<br>
You can comb your dog’s hair and look for ticks yourself with a magnifying glass, or take them to your veterinarian for a check-up. Ticks can get embedded into your pet’s skin making it itchy and red.
<br>
<br>
If you’ve spotted a tick, you’ll want to try and get it removed before it begins to become embedded deeply. Owners often confuse ticks with other skin conditions, so get a vet’s opinion before it becomes too late. Dogs do not pick up a disease from ticks instantly, but the chances of contracting one increases the more time a tick stays in contact with your pet.
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><b>Removing a tick</b></font>
<br>
<br>
Removing a tick is complicated. You should consult with a veterinarian if you find ticks on your dog.
